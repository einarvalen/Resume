On top of a Bachelor Degree, I have more than 25 years of professional experience from the IT
industry – doing consulting and software development work - international project- and contract
development in a variety of industries: IT & Electronics, Oil & Gas, Construction, Health Care,
Publishing, Banking & finance, Government ...

Throughout my career, I have had full software life cycle project responsibilities through requirements,
analysis, design, development, implementation, documentation, user training, maintenance and
management. I have had lead roles and solo assignments - working on applications such as Enterprise
Portals, ERP, Logistics, Banking, Business process automation and tracking, Business Intelligence,
Operations and more.

I started off, programming Cobol and assembler on mainframes/minis, via 4GL and SQL I moved
on to Unix, C and later Windows, Linux, C++ and Object Orientation. Since 1997 I have accrued
a varied Java development experience. Over the years I have touche on many development method-
ologies. Waterfall based at first, later iterative, agile ones. I have international work experience
from the US, Scandinavia, UK and Australia. I am fluent in English and Scandinavian and also used
to speak some German.

I am used to high paced, high pressured, work situations. - I am easy to work with and do
well in mentoring and lead roles. My communication and documentation skills are very good. I like
a challenge, I am creative and can think outside the box, and I push myself hard to deliver quality
results on time.
